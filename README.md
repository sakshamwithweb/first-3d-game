## First 3d Game
Well I think I took too much time but yeah I it is my first 3d game in which you control a car and can do WASD

Though, I wanted to do many things but failed to implement:
- a deformed ground with gravity like effect
- turn and drive at the same time (WA,WD,SA,SD)
- An infinite ground

Controls:
- W/S: Forward/Backward
- A/D: Turn Left or Right Side

I know the camera is moving incorrect with the model but I'll fix later..
